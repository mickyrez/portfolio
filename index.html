		My name is Michael Gutierrez and I am a Web Developer. Ever since I can remember I have been interested in computers and what they are capable of. I am always striving to push the boundaries and Web Development is the perfect environment to do so.<br> 
		It all started when I was introduced to a trial version of Adobe Dreamweaver when I was 10 years old. I was fascinated by hyperlinks and the fact that you could display information in so many different and interactive ways.</p><br>
		<p>When I made my first website I was so excited that I showed everyone that I knew and the positive reinforcement I received then led me to persue my passion. <br>
		I made several web sites in my free time throughout highschool but I spent most of my time with photo manipulation in Adobe Photoshop and dabbled in some animation.</p><br>
		<p>
		Upon completing the HSC, while everyone else was still confused about their ambitions for the future, I was wholehearted in my decision to continue my studies in Web Development and obtain a prospective career in this field.</p> 
		<p>
		I originally anticipated studying at the University of Wollongong, but as they did not have a course specific to my interests, I decided to do a Diploma of Information Technology (Multimedia) at Wollongong TAFE. <br>
		I felt this course was more suitable to the field of IT that I wished to explore, so I pressed through the 18 month course in only one year, and luckily by then, the University of Wollongong had just released a Web Design and Development Major for the Bachelor of Information Technology course.<br>
		While this was good news, everytime I introduce myself to someone and they ask me what I do it can be a bit of a mouthful.</p>


		I am concerned with the balance between design that is beautiful, design that is functional, and design that is intelligent. I challenge myself to achieve the finest relation between those three in every project. Work that embodies all of these qualities sensibly can be enjoyed timelessly.
